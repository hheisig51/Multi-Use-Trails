List of Additional Updates for the Physical Counter we made.


3/21/2024:
- Updated main readme 
- Notes on the counter:
     - Data Saving --> When unplugging the pico, the data resets. Emma suggested writing the data to a file.
     - Sensor Sensitivity --> The sensor seems sensitive yet also not sensitive enough. I'll need to play around with the numbers.
     - Method of Powering --> Right now the sensor is powered by USB to the computer. We should power it with a battery instead.
     - Annoyances with Assembly --> The process of putting the box together was quite annoying. I could try making more things friction fit or try another method. Maybe out of the scope of this project.
 
Week of 4/8/2024:
- This week I'm learning about about storage on the Pico. Getting data to save seems to be quite complicated, more than I thought it'd be.
