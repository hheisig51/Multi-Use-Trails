# Multi-Use-Trails

A Capstone Engineering project about collecting data on pedestrian traffic and opinions of the Triangle Trails, a multi-use trail next to Charlottesville High School. Created by Logan Martin and Emma Heisig, Charlottesville High School Class of 2024 Students.

Possible sensors to use from mentors & customers:
- Mobile eye tracking glasses (with video): this tracks eye-movements like fixations to understand attention better
- Smartwatches: heart rate is mainly what we have tracked with this but I think it also can track other physiologic elements 
- Light sensor: to track lighting levels in lux 
- Air Quality sensor: we recently ordered an AirBeam monitor for a study so I am not super family with this yet but we should have it by next week
- bike/ped counters
