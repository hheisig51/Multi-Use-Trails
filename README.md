## Planning

### Client

Our client is Mr. Thomas Safranek, the bike and pedestrian coordinator for the City of Charlottesville. After reaching out to the city's Transportation Planning Manager, Mr. Ben Chambers, he believed that our project would work better with Mr. Safranek.

### Project Requirements

Problem: Lack of, or outdated, data on how Multi-Use Trails, specifically Triangle Trails, impact the CHS community.

Solution: Collect data on people's opinion's & usage of Triangle Trails.

| # | Essential Requirements | Non-Essential Requirements |
| - | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 | Collect data on when people use the trails | Take community survey |
| 2 | Design and build sensors in-lab, keeping privacy in mind | Find out demographics of people who use the trails |
| 3 | Find out use patterns of the trails | Add physical change to Triangle Trails |
| 4 | Analyze collected data to propose how trails could be improved | Observe patterns immediately surrounding the trails |

### Timeline

- Weeks 1-3: Research how to collect data, order parts 
- Weeks 4-7: Build and test data collection system
- Weeks 8-16: Collect, organize, and interpret data
- Weeks 17-22: Draw larger conclusions with guidance from experts
- Weeks 23-24: Prepare for final presentation

### Deliverable

The documentation for the deliverable can be found [here under the Our-Physical-Counter-yay folder](Our-Physical-Counter-yay/Documentation/README_PhysicalCounter.md) As a side note, we also collected data on biking and walking need of our high school. That data is for local people only, and we wouldn't want to make that public because it contains more personal information.
