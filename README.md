# Multi-Use-Trails

A Capstone Engineering project about collecting data on pedestrian traffic and opinions of the Triangle Trails, a multi-use trail next to Charlottesville High School. Created by Logan Martin and Emma Heisig, Charlottesville High School Class of 2024 Students.

## Progress Updates

### Most Recent Update

#### 2023-10-23 to 2023-10-27

We've made a survey to find the biking needs at CHS and updated our customer. We have also begun a survey for walking needs at CHS. The plan is to finalize these surveys and send them out either next week or sometime soon.


### Previous Updates

#### 2023-10-16 to 2023-10-22

We met with our mentors and our client (Mr. Thomas Safranek, the bike and pedestrian coordinator for the City of Charlottesville), and determined that data collection will most likely occur starting January.

He helped us identify two spots to place sensors:

- One that we had already planned on, the bridge/asphalt path between CHS and the YMCA.
- The other is the unofficial path between CHS and the Meadowcreek Parkway. We would place the sensor on city property, measuring how many walk across the private property to get there.

#### 2023-10-07 to 2023-10-15

This week we researched ways to gather data for the Triangle Trails.
In addition to this, we emailed our mentors and customers to ask them what resources might be available to us.

UVA Link Lab (specifically, ORCL/Oracle Lab):

- **Mobile eye-tracking glasses**: equipped with video, these track eye movements to gather data on attention.
- **Smartwatches**: largely used for monitoring heart rate, but should be able to track other physical quantities.
- **Light sensor**: measures light levels in lux (lx). One lux is equal to one lumen per square meter.
- **Air quality sensor**: AirBeam sensor, a handheld "instrument that measures hyperlocal concentrations of harmful microscopic particles in the air, known as particulate matter, as well as humidity and temperature" ([HabitatMap.com](https://www.habitatmap.org/airbeam)).

City of Charlottesville Department of Transportation:

- **Pyroelectric infrared sensor**: "Pyroelectric detectors are thermal detectors: Temperature fluctuations produce a charge change on the surface of pyroelectric crystals, which produces a corresponding electrical signal. This temperature gradient can be created by the absorption of light." ([LASERCOMPONENTS.com](https://www.lasercomponents.com/us/news/pyroelectric-detectors-materials-applications-and-working-principle/#:~:text=Pyroelectric%20detectors%20are%20thermal%20detectors,by%20the%20absorption%20of%20light.))
- **Pneumatic tubes**: "Pneumatic road tube sensors send a burst of air pressure along a rubber tube when a vehicle's tires pass over the tube. The pressure pulse closes an air switch, producing an electrical signal that is transmitted to a counter or analysis software. The pneumatic road tube sensor is portable, using lead-acid, gel, or other rechargeable batteries as a power source."

#### 2023-09-11 to 2023-10-06

This was the time period between our individual presentations, and when we presented as a group.

## Research

Multi-use trail data collection methods:

- Camera
- Surveys
  - Can send them out for BKT at CHS
- Pressure sensor to detect people in/on the trail
- Weather (?)
