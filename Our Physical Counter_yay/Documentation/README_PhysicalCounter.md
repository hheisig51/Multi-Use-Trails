We decided to make a physical counter of our own to better understand how they work. In short, a counter for data collection should involve a sensor, a way to power the device overall, a way to collect and/or display the data, and a way to reset the data on the counter. 

Following this, here's a list of our essentials for a counter:
- Sensor: Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 (5V))
- Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico
- Powering device: using USB connection from Pico to Computer.
- A way to collect and/or display the data: LCD w/ backpack that shows the 'Sensor count'.
- A way to reset the data: a pushbutton that resets data when pushed.
