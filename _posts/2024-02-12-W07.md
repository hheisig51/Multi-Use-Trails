This week, we met with one of our mentors, who gave us helpful advice for our project.

The most significant thing she helped us discover is that there's a chance we have the sensor set up in a position that is incorrectly recording data. Due to the shallowness of the sensors, and the altitude changes of the trails, we may be recording the traffic of a side path, rather than the main path.
