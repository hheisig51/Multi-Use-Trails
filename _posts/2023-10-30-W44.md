We researched what the city is doing regarding walking needs. The city has made route maps, crossing guards, and projects to make walking to school safer. However, these things mostly pertain to other schools and not CHS. Granted, the city states that CHS is about a 30-minute walk for most and they recommend people use the city bus. They some info on how to go about doing that, which is great. From this, it seems there isn't a large amount of walking needs at CHS, but our survey could tell us otherwise.
