We've been manually collecting data for the past few weeks, and while it hasn't been overly challenging, we've decided to enhance our project by addressing some issues we've identified during the data collection process.

# General Issues

- You have to walk to the sensors, wake them up, then pull data from them. This can be tedious, especially as you use more and more sensors.
- The number that the sensors provide is unclear. It doesn't seem to match any raw traffic.

# Pedestrian Counter Comments

- The weather was cold, which made the all-metal sensor difficult to work with.
- The steel mounting bands were bent very tightly, and require a hammer to flatten and fix.
- We're exploring creating a mounting band in CAD, and adjusting the dimensions to suit our project.

# Bike Counter Comments

- Due to the cold weather, the tape did not adhere, and the tubes were not held down.
- We have temporarily pushed the tubes to the side to prevent damage.

Additionally, we contacted Eco-Counter, the manufacturer of these sensors. They graciously supplied us with a full catalog of their products, and the accompanying prices. Some of these new counters even have cellular capabilities, allowing for remote collection.
