![Pedestrian Data snapshot from 2024-03-01](/assets/2024-03-01_pedestrian-data.png)

Key Points:

- We're seeing an average of about 30-35 units of growth per week.

- 30-35 over 5 school days gets us to roughly 6-7 units of growth per day. Splitting that further indicates 3-3.5 units of growth per passing period (the time before and after the school day). We're unsure as to how many people a unit is.

- The growth is fairly linear, suggesting a consistent group of people walking by.
