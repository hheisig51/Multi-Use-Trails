# What did we work on?

This week we plan to analyze the data we got from the surveys we sent out. We are happy with the response rates, and we plan to share our data and analysis with transit planners. 

# Decisions Made

# New Resources Found

# Issues Discovered

# Successful Aspects

# Challenges Faced

# Next Week's Plan
Check in with mentors to see when we can use the data collection resources. We'd also love to go to the Trianlge Trail more often.
