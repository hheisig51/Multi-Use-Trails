# What did we work on?

This week we plan to analyze the data we got from the surveys we sent out. We are happy with the response rates, but hope to see more by sending the survey out again.


# Decisions Made

We will meet with Safranek at 8am on January 2nd to deployed the bike/ped counters.


# New Resources Found

More people and information from survey, and people to give out the survey. 

# Issues Discovered

We wanted more responses are sending out the survey again, this has proven effective. 

# Successful Aspects

We have recieved more responses to our surveys, almost double than our previous update on this.


# Challenges Faced

Keeping busy has occationally been a challenge. 


# Next Week's Plan

Check in with mentors to see when we can use the data collection resources. We'd also love to go to the Triangle Trail sometime soon. Also analysis of data if need-be.
