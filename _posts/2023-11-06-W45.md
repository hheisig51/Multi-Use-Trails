# What did you work on?

This week was a 3-day week. During that time, we created smart goals and updated the GitHub page.

# What decisions were made?

Instead of making one survey for both walking and biking needs, we've decided to continue using two separate surveys.

# What new resources did you find?

Ms. Williams, the department head of English.

# What new issues were discovered?

Staying on top of what we've talked about with various people.

# What went well?

Our capstone engineering assignments specifically have gone well.

# What was difficult?

It's challenging to keep track of things when multiple people are on a project. Sometimes it feels like there's nothing to do but wait or a lot to do.

# What is your plan for next week?

We plan to send out surveys next week.
